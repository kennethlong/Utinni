# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-16)

**Core value:** A modder downloads Utinni, installs once, and from a single application can see, edit, and live-preview every asset the SWG client loads — replacing the fragmented 15-year-old editor zoo with one stable, plugin-driven tool.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — CI + Tier 1 C# scaffold (not started)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (CI + Tier 1 C# scaffold)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-16 -- Phase 01 planning complete
Next action: `/gsd:plan-phase 1`

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log lives in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. V1 starts with four locked anti-goal decisions (DEC-A1..A4 — not a server-side manager, not a launcher, not a DCC, not a cheat enabler) and three non-locked candidate decisions (DEC-C1 product target, DEC-C2 anti-goals as scope filter, DEC-C3 tiered testing strategy).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None active. Eleven open questions (CON-O-01..CON-O-11) are tracked as phase-gated unresolved constraints — see ROADMAP.md "Open-Question → Phase Mapping" section. Each gates exactly one phase plan and is not a blocker until that phase is being planned.

## Ingest Provenance

Bootstrapped 2026-05-16 via `/gsd:ingest-docs` from `docs/ai/vision.md`, `docs/ai/assessment.md`, and `docs/ai/test-harness-plan.md`. Zero blockers, zero warnings, four INFO items auto-resolved (all three sources are DOC-precedence; reciprocal vision↔assessment cross-reference is benign narrative linkage). Codebase intel at `.planning/codebase/` (from prior `/gsd:map-codebase`) treated as read-only reference. Synthesis artefacts at `.planning/intel/` (SYNTHESIS.md, decisions.md, requirements.md, constraints.md, context.md) and conflict report at `.planning/INGEST-CONFLICTS.md`.
